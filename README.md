# shop.io
This Ecommerce application provides a seamless online shopping experience with client and admin panels. The server is built with Node.js and Express, using JWT for authentication. Integration of PayPal and Stripe APIs ensures secure payment processing. The app includes features such as a purchase summary and sending it by email, as well as a password reset functionality that sends a recovery email using Nodemailer. MongoDB serves as the database with the Mongoose ODM for easy interaction.
